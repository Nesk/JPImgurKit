# JPImgurKit

__JPImgurKit__ is an Objective-C library created to easily handle [Imgur](http://imgur.com) API requests within iOS and OS X apps, it is built on [AFNetworking](http://afnetworking.com/) and its [OAuth extension](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFOAuth2Client). The project is at an early stage, I'm currently prototyping the classes so __don't use this library__ unless you want to test it.
